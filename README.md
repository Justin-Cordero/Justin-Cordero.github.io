## Technologies used

This portfolio was built as a simple static website using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. A heavy emphasis was put on utilizing modern CSS practices such as transitions, animations, grid, flexbox and pseudo-classes. Also, media queries were used to ensure responsiveness on smaller devices.  

[Formspree](https://formspree.io/) was used to handle the contact form without needing to set up a backend.
